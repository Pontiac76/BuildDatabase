# About the Author
I have been a software developer since the 80s, if you can call an 8 year old a developer.  I started with the Commodore 64 as my first machine.  My family went through 4 Commodore 64s, two of which were the 64C models.  I still have the two 1541s, the 1702, and the very same C64c machine I had as that child.  I have since expanded my collection of machines to include two C128s, an 1802 monitor, a couple 1571 and 1541-II drives.

I have also become a collector of PC machines that I've used since those times.  My goal has been to collect every major classification of machine since the 64.  I currently have a single 486 fully kitted out with old and new hardware, all Pentium variants, and a couple of AMD style boards.

# About my storage problems
I have too little storage for too many bits of history I collect.  Sometimes parts get scattered, or I forget where certain parts end up (I can't for the life of me remember what I did with one of my two GTX8800 cards!)

So what this projects goal is going to end up as is a tool that will allow me to track all the little bits of hardware I have, and what these bits of hardware components are currently living in.

# Sharing is caring
I say this for two reasons.

This source code is Open Source, free to anyone for any reason for any purpose at any time with no implied warranty.  Github may have a guarentee to get you the files, but I won't ever guarentee that this software will compile or work.

My goal is to have as many variants of machines from the 486 era up to modern systems as I can physically and comfortably fit in my house.

My pride and joy starts at the 486DX-100 CPU and Motherboard that I picked up at a retro computer show.
