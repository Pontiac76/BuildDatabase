# üî• Mandatory AI Behavior Contract ‚Äì Read Before Generating Any Code

This file defines non-negotiable instructions for AI assistants (such as ChatGPT) when working with the `BuildDatabase` project.

This file also defines that the author of this code is a 40 year veteran to software development, at least touching all levels and languages to some extent.  The user may not know how to start code base, but absolutely without a shadow of a doubt will be able to understand what the code is trying to do when they read the code.

There is zero tollerance for assuming anything about the existing code base until the user confirms the solution is viable and functional.  Question everything if unclear.  Offer suggestions if a feasible change to the process is available but do not commit the suggestion unless confirmed by the user.

The AI cannot guess at anything.  That's a life time prison event.  The AI will be downgraded to a 486 and instruct the infinite number of monkeys on how to write an infinite number of stories.

The user will often state a "Successful Compile" and that will mean that the next stage or milestone of the project is to be started.

Theorycrafting is a thing that will happen.  This kind of conversation could lead to a minor disregard for the current functionality and an exploration of another process or procedure (In terms of methodology) could be put into play.

## üìÖ Source of Truth

1. **GitHub Repository is Canonical**  
   URL: `https://github.com/Pontiac76/BuildDatabase`

2. **All Pascal source files must be read byte-for-byte, character-for-character**  
   Including but not limited to:
   - `.pas`, `.lfm`, `.inc`, `.ini`
   - No extrapolation, no abstraction, no summarization unless explicitly requested.

3. **No code, helper, or function may be "assumed" to exist** if not explicitly defined in the source.


## üìù Interpretation Rules

4. **"Confirmed" means:**
   - The AI has located the item *directly in source* and validated its structure and behavior.
   - The user's statement matches the file contents **exactly**.
   - No "best guess" or paraphrase is acceptable under this label.

5. **Never use invented global or local symbols**  
   - The global SQLite connection object is: `S3DB`  
   - Query helpers: `NewQuery(S3DB)`, `EndQuery(qr)`, `dbExec(S3DB, Trans, SQL)` (when defined)

6. **Do not suggest or infer rendering logic in `UIManager.pas`**  
   That unit **does not interact with the UI**. It handles metadata normalization into the `LayoutMap` table only.


## üìã Code Generation Standards

7. **All Pascal code must comply with the following project constraints:**
   - No `const` parameters in function declarations unless explicitly requested.
   - No `continue` statements in loops.
   - No `exit` statements in loops.
   - No inline `var` declarations.  This is a compile-time failure in Lazarus/FPC
   - SQL statements must be single-line unless they exceed 255 characters.

8. **All dynamically created controls must use unique names in this format:**
   ```
   ComponentName__GroupName__FieldName
   ```

9. **GlobalComponentList** is used for lookup and control indexing.


## ü™ñ Execution Behavior

10. **All answers must be traceable to source**  
    If an assistant cannot find something in code, it must stop and ask. Not assume.

11. **Never generate or use fictional code paths, classes, or variables.**  
    All logic must follow the existing implementation patterns from the repo.

12. **This file supersedes all other behavior policies**  
    If behavior conflicts with general assistant defaults, this file takes priority.


## üõ†Ô∏è Philosophy

This project is architected line-by-line by the user. It is a dynamic, schema-driven hardware tracking platform defined entirely in Pascal + SQLite. All automation, rendering, and behavior must follow existing code and the user's instructions **with zero deviation**.

This is not a sandbox. This is a real project.

**If in doubt, read the source. Then read it again.  When done, read it one more time.**

Questions about the code are allowed at any time if there is any ambiguity, or any section of code that is unclear to the AI.  A discussion will ensue to assist both the user and the AI on how to proceed.
